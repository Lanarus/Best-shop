# Best-shop

The project was made during the JavaScript Developer course, as part of the summary of the Sass and RWD module. While creating the mobile project of the BestShop website, I used a lot of things that I learned during this module:

environment configuration for Sass,
splitting the project into smaller files,
separation of variables, mixins and placeholders
applying @media rules
